# Game Development Project with Continuous Deployment

Welcome to my game development project! This repository contains the source code for a game that is continuously deployed using AWS services.

## Access the Game

You can play the latest version of the game [here](http://awss3deploymentprocess.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/).

## Technologies Used

- **GitHub:** For version control and code management.
- **AWS CodePipeline:** For automating the build, test, and deployment process.
- **Amazon S3:** For hosting and serving the deployed game files.

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Repository:** The source code is maintained in a GitHub repository.
2. **AWS CodePipeline:** Monitors the GitHub repository for changes. When changes are detected, it triggers the pipeline to build, test, and deploy the game.
3. **Build and Test:** The code is automatically built and tested. If the build is successful, it proceeds to deployment.
4. **Amazon S3:** The built game files are deployed to an Amazon S3 bucket, which hosts the game and makes it available via a public URL.
